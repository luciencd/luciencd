I moved back to New York City right after turning 27. I was driven for a multitude of reasons - returning home, the dynamicism, the allowances for night owls, the diversity of thought and career paths and general openness of its residents. 

I left for Boston in 2018 because I felt staying in the same place would not allow me to evolve. I needed that break from the nest - to not be held back by expectations. When friends, family, communities - cities even - know you for a while, it's hard to change. Subconciously or not, its a gravitational well preventing growth, preventing oneself from experimentation.

After 5 years of living in boston, I built up a great community of friends up and down I-93. But it was time to come back home, to the place that I feel most aligns with my values and habits. So I chose to come back to Brooklyn.


I stayed at my parents place in fort greene on my childhood bedframe, and while working from home at my software engineering job, contacted realtors, landlords and began my journey back to the city I knew as a teenager.

From start to finish, my apartment searching journey took 2 months, but I learned so much in the process.



This article will give the most leverage to someone aiming to living alone. However it can still be applicable to joining an existing set of roommates at a place, or if you have multiple people all going for one apartment - just use your critical thinking skills. 

I've lived with and without roommates since I was in college at 17. I've lived in the biggest city in America, i've lived in a college dorm in a rust belt small town, I lived in boston proper, the suburbs of boston, I've lived with a car, without a car, attached to public transit, in the suburbs, in a rural coliving hostel community for 3 months in the middle of new hampshire. I've even slept in my car for a few weeks at a time.


#### The general steps to maximizing the joy to money ratio of your apartment in nyc is as follows:

##### 1. Figure out what you value that others don't value and figure out what you don't that others do.

##### 2. Assess the truth about the apartment that your landlord or realtor won't tell you(clickbait title honestly).

##### 3. Strengthen your negotiating position, and not reveal your weak points. Give yourself the ability to walk away.

##### 4. Calmly negotiate the rent price and broker fee and close quickly.

##### 5. Finally, enjoy your new life as a new yorker and discover the inevitable detail you missed!
